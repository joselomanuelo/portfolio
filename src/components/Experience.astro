      "In this role, I was tasked with improving an application whose primary functionality involved constantly reading from a MongoDB database undergoing frequent mutations and serving an API for a larger project. Upon conducting an initial review, it became clear that a complete rewrite was necessary to address the existing limitations and ensure long-term maintainability.I led the redesign process by applying best practices that extended beyond academic-level approaches and focused on real-world application standards. The solution was built using Python's Flask framework and implemented Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to establish a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture.",
